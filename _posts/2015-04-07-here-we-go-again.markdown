A little over 16 years ago I first got access to public\_html. 
And with this site I almost feel like I have come full circle.

I probably still have that first homepage archived somewhere. 
It started as a few pages with generic content. Then came frames... 
At some point I found myself maintaining a set of web pages that contained meeting minutes.
Somebody would provide me with word documents and I would convert those to html; 
hand editing tags so that everything would line up.

A few years later I got a personnal internet connection and a domain name that came with it. 
And a [friend][Jany] helped revamp my homepage with a little bit of frame maker magic.
Maybe I'll dig out those pages and import them here at some point...
Anyway, back then there was no versioning. Changes were just made live, with maybe a ...\_old backup somewhere...

Then for a few years having a personal page dropped off my radar. 
I tried some blogging platforms like blogger. 
But it felt like keeping things within a circle of private family and friends was not that straighforward.
And then that [ubiquitous][Facebook] social network came into the picture, 
with the [search giant][GooglePlus] and a [little bird][Twitter] soon to follow. 
But I never went full steam with either of these platforms.

And now with this page it seems that I have gone full circle. Maybe with a few improvements...

* Git has come along. [Happy birthday][GitBirthday] git by the way !
* It's easy to host webpages with github.
* jekyll makes it easy to create content in a structured way.
* And themes that can be cloned in github (like [the one I'm using][JekyllTheme]) make it very easy to get started.

So we'll see where this goes...
